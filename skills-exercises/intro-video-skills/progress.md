# Progress Pesto remote program

## Week 1

### Day 1 Monday 18 May, 2020

    1. Expressing Programs HW
       1. duplicate-letters
       2. is-triangle
       3. sum-all
       4. sum-fibs
       5. sum-primes
    2. Limitations in expressing solutions to problems:
       1. machine limitations
          1. way of solution is limited by machine's memory, network
       2. language limitations
          1. functions might not be available
          2. way of solution might be tedious in the given langauge
       3. programmer limitations
          1. lack of knowledge of framework
          2. lack of knowledge of algorithms
          3. skillset
    3. Programming paradigms
       1. Imperative
          1. use of control structures
          2. using assignements
          3. modifying mutable variables
          4. tell machine what to do and how to do it
       2. Decalarative
          1. tell the computer what to do rather than how to do it e.g sql query to find and list of certain things
          2. Functional and logical programming
          3. Functional programming: evaluation of mathematical functions, avoids changing state and mutable data
    4. List of books:
           - The Psychology of Computer Programming by Gerald M. Weinberg
           - [] The Pragmatic Programmer by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas
           - The Next 700 Programming Languages – P. J. Landin
           - Can Programming Be Liberated from the von Neumann Style? – John Backus
           - Programming as an Experience: the inspiration for Self* – Smith Ungar
  
### Day 2 Tuesday 19 May, 2020

    1. Excercises
       1. cache-function
          1. memoization
             1. closures: A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. 
             2. higher order functions: Functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them, are called higher-order functions.
       2. flip-args
       3. limit-funcition-call-count
       4. math-fns

### Day 3 Wednesday 20 May, 2020

    1. Clean Code
       1. descriptive and correct names
       2. explicit code (no implicit logics)
       3. avoid negative conditionals ?
       4. name should describe side-effects?
       5. encapsulate conditionals
       6. e.g if else part is important it should be visible first
       7. dont add unneeded context
    2. Functions
       1. limit parameters so as to make testing easier
       2. code should be predictable
       3. function should do one thing only
       4. functions should be of one level of abstraction
    3. Good code
       1. there are not extraneous dependencies among classes
       2. need of comments should be minimal
    4. Books
       1. [] *Clean Code* by **Robert C. Martin**
       2. [] The Pragmatic Programmer by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas
       3. Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code — Kent Beck, and Martin Fowl
       4. Literate Programming —  Donald E. Knuther
       5. Beautiful Code — Andy Oram, Greg Wilson
       6. Structured Programming —  O.-J. Dahl, E. W. Dijkstra, and C. A. R. Hoare
    5. Excercises
